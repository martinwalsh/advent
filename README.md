# Advent of Code

This project provides a bit of automation to assist in authoring solutions for Advent of Code 2018.
In each directory you'll find (most of) what you need to start a new puzzle for a given programming
language. You are encouraged to solve each puzzle by writing unit tests.

Implemented in haste, you will likely find several errors or omissions here. But, contributions are
most welcome and greatly appreciated.

## Quick Start

To generate boilerplate for the next puzzle, run `make next` in the language directory of your
choosing. Edit the source to implement a solution, add unit tests and run `make test` to validate.
Rise and repeat!

## Requirements

* GNU make
* docker
* docker-compose
